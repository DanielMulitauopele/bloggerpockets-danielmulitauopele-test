## Description/Purpose

This application was built to demonstrate my proficiency and ability to use Ruby on Rails, as well
as my understanding of MVC best practices and RESTful API creation. As a candidate for the junior
software development position at BiggerPockets, I hope this application demonstrates my aptitude for critical thinking, a disposition toward refactoring, and an orientation toward agile processes. The prompt for this project is listed below.

## Prompt

This repository contains a very basic Rails 5 app.
The code contains many problems: please **identify** these problems and propose **fixes**.

It is not essential to run the app in order to find the issues, but it may help you to do so and that's totally fine. The standard Rails startup procedure should be enough:

````
$ bundle
$ bin/rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
$ bin/rails s
````

## Setup

To setup this application locally, take the following steps:

* Clone this repository down into a local directory of your choice.

* Run bundle
* Run rails db:{create,migrate,seed}
* Run rails s
